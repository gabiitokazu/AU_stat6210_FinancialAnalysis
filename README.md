#### Full Assignment:

Suppose that you are working in an investment bank as a quantitative analyst. Your boss asks you to create a portfolio for one of your clients. The client wants to find the portfolio with the smallest variance that satisfies the following constraints:

- Considers only 5 companies of the S&P500.
- The investment C is exactly $1,000,000.
- You are allowed to invest in a maximum of 3 stocks.

If needed, it is possible to consider weights with negative values. This means that you are allowed to short stocks.

Your boss wants you to

- compute all possible portfolios that satisfy the clientâ€™s constraints,
- for each portfolio size (i.e. 1, 2 and 3 stocks) create a matrix with understandable row and column names in which, for each portfolio, you will store
     - weights (when considering more than one stock in a portfolio),
     - expected returns and
     - risk,
- represent them graphically as (for example) in the graph below, and
- provide the weights of the best (i.e. minimum variance) portfolio with expected return and risk (i.e. variance).


##### Required Assignment Outputs
- `ToTheClient.Rmd` Produce a short html file (not more than the equivalent of two pages) representing a brief financial report for the client (no code details) describing what was done and what your conclusions are.

- `ToTheBoss.Rmd` Provide an html file for your boss which would allow them to replicate your analysis based on your explanations, codes and comments.
